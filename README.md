# Pyramid Order Data Entry Form for Interactive Brokers

This is just a simple GUI I created to help me with my pyramid orders for my stock trading.

Enter in your portfolio-level inputs along with the ticker.

Then enter where you want to buy, the size, and the stop loss. 

The rest is calculated for you when you press the **Calculate** button.

Orders are sent to IBKR when you click **Execute Order**. 

Update the defaults.ini file to set up your default portfolio settings, as well as your TWS API config.
